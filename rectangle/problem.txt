You are required to write code in the language of your choice implementing certain algorithms
that analyze rectangles and features that exist among rectangles.
Your implementation is required to cover the following:

1. Intersection: You must be able to determine whether two rectangles have one or more
intersecting lines and produce a result identifying the points of intersection.

2. Containment: You must be able to determine whether a rectangle is wholly contained within
another rectangle.

3. Adjacency: Implement the ability to detect whether two rectangles are adjacent. Adjacency is
defined as the sharing of a side. Side sharing may be proper or sub-line, where a sub-line share
is one where one side of rectangle A is a line that exists as a set of points wholly contained
on some other side of rectangle B.

Your implementation should capture the rectangle entity as well as the operations listed above.
